# ML_Collage_App

## Description: 

This is a simple creative app that removes the background of the object within a photo and adds it into the canvas. The user can add multiple images and drag and drop the processed image into a new position within the canvas. There is a 'save' button to export the image to a local directory. The code utilizes [P5js](https://p5js.org/) and [RunwayML] to access the ML library [BASNet](https://github.com/NathanUA/BASNet)'BASNet: Boundary-Aware Salient Object Detection code'.
